## python SQLite3 API for DDL and DML

Comming form a unix/linux background ive always found Widows powershell to be confusing and cumbersome.
This is especcially true when I work with SQLite3.
Since most of my analysis in is python, I created this API for simple CRUD stuff when I need to do data analysis on my local machine.
It's rudimentary but very easy to use.
